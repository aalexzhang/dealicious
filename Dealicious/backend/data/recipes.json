This way all your flavours are seeping into your meat.Pat chicken dry with paper towel, rub the chicken all over with a 2tsp of salt, pepper and olive oil. Not only are you further flavouring the chicken, but the chicken skin will be crispier when roasted.Put chicken on to a roasting pan, pour lemon juice around it. Put lemon skins and remaining thyme underneath the chicken.Roast for 10 minutes on 220C, then lower the heat to 180 C and cook for a further 25- 35 mins depending on how large the chicken is.You can check if your chicken is ready by inserting a skewer/ fork into the thickest part ( thigh). If the juices run clear, your chicken is ready. If its still is pink, leave it in for a couple more minutes.Take chicken out, keep warm and rest the chicken while you make the sauce.Sauce on the side: Deglaze the roasting pan with a little white wine and chicken stock, bring to a simmer.",
