# Our Mission
Eating healthily on a budget is a big challenge for many students. Our project will address the lack of a centralized platform combining healthy recipes with local discounts and sales, to specifically target university students on a limited budget. We hope to close the gap between students' convenience, cost, and affordable healthy eating by developing a web-based application.

# Features
- Weekly meal plans catered to individual dietary requirements and budgets
- An ideal meal plan featuring breakfast, lunch, and dinner, complete with recipes, step-by-step instructions, and detailed nutrition information.
- A grocery page where users can filter and view specific on-sale items with ease.

# Testing Protocol

| Test Description       | Pre-conditions | Test Steps                                        | Expected Result                             | Expected Deficiency                          |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Meal Plan Cards  | User is on the meal plan page | 1. Navigate to the meal plan page<br>2. Click through the Day 1-7 buttons | User should see 3 meal cards for 7 days, clicking on the day buttons should change the recipes. | Cards may not load if API credits are used up |
| Meal Plan Filtering | User is on the meal plan page | 1. Click on the Nutrition Option for Gluten Free<br>2. Click on the Cuisine Option for American | The recipes should update to Gluten Free and American recipes | Cards may not load if API credits are used up, using filters may not work if API credits are used up |
| Meal Plan Deals | User is on the meal plan page | 1. Click through the days buttons  | User should see a highlight for discounted ingredients | |
| Grocery Deals Page | User is on the grocery deals page  | 1. Navigate to the grocery deals page                  | User should see grocery deals for ingredients with discount amounts, images, and ratings. These ingredients should match with discounted ingredients on the meal plan page. Users should also be able to filter through the items with various categories, ratings, and tags, as well as sort items based on most discounts or least price. Users will also be able to search for specific produce that is in our dataset using the search bar. | Produce data doesn't currently filter by the store selections, because for this MVP we are pulling from dummy data that doesn't incorporate real-life store data and their produce data. |
| Shopping List Page | User is on the shopping cart page | 1. From grocery deals page, click onto the shopping bag icon to put produce item into shopping list<br>2. Navigate into shopping cart through my coupons<br>3. View the shopping cart and clip available coupons | Within shopping cart page, users should be able to view the items they have saved from grocery deals page and see if coupons are available. They should be able to delete items from shopping list if they no longer need that item  | Currently with the lack of an accessible API, real-time coupon links are not available to clip within the webpage. 
| Landing Page | User is on the landing/home page | 1. Navigate to the Home page | Users should be able to view appropriate images, videos, and user reviews showcasing the functions of this webpage. Additionally, buttons such as "get shopping" or "explore more" should lead users to meal plan page or grocery deals page appropriately. | 
| Onboarding Page | User is on the onboarding survey page | 1. Navigate to the onboarding survey by clicking get started on the home page.<br>2. Answer provided questions and click through the survey until completion | Users should be able to answer onboarding survey prompts, see the progress bar to track progress and see completion page that links to first meal plan. | Due to limitations on recipe data with current API, current MVP does not completely personalize meal plan recommendations from onboarding survey |



# Bugs
- Since we're using Render for hosting the backend and the frontend, the backend will spin down after inactivity. When opening the website it might not show grocery items in the grocery deal page or recipes in the meal plan page while the backend is redeploying.
- Some recipes may not have instructions or ingredients, due to limitations in the Spoonacular API.
